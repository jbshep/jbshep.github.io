Searching and Sorting

The Sorting Problem
-------------------

Do you stream music online?  Do you click on a folder on your desktop to find
and organize your files?  Have you ever used Microsoft Excel to keep information
in a spreadsheet?  If we think for a moment about these software programs, we
might realize that they have some features in common.  One we might notice is
that they eventually allow a user to *sort* information.  In a music streaming
app, you might choose to order your songs by title or by artist to make certain
songs easier to find.  When you're looking at a folder full of files, you might
order your files by file name or by the date it was last modified.  In Excel, we
can sort a column of data, which has the effect of rearranging the rows into a
different order.

Sorting is a very common thing that programs do, and it is an interesting
problem that can be tackled in a lot of different ways.  In this introductory
book you're reading right now, we will look at only one of those ways.  In doing
so, we'll also get better at walking through a problem logically in order to
write a program that solves a problem.  The end result will be that we improve
our natural problem solving abilities, too.  If you continue learning about
computer science through other courses and other books, you'll encounter other
ways to perform sorting, some of which have really interesting capabilities.
Well, what are we waiting for?

.. _sec_sort_algo:

Towards an Algorithm for Sorting
--------------------------------

In this section, we will start developing an algorithm for sorting.  An
*algorithm* is a series of well defined steps for solving a problem that has an
input, an output, and completes in a reasonable amount of time.  (The meaning of
"reasonable" in this context is discussed in greater detail in more advanced
computer science texts.)

Suppose we have a list of numbers, defined as such.

.. code-block:: python

   numbers = [8, 4, 3, 9, 5]

If we were to sort this list into *ascending* order, it would look like this.

.. code-block:: python

   numbers = [3, 4, 5, 9, 8]

A thoughtful reader might ask what happens if we have duplicate numbers.  In
other words, what if ``numbers`` were defined like this?

.. code-block:: python

   numbers = [3, 2, 3, 1, 4]

Note that we have two 3's in our list.  The sorted version would look like this.

.. code-block:: python

   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4]

The two 3's remain preserved in the sorted list.  We certainly wouldn't want to
lose items, so this makes sense.  We used the word *ascending* to describe how
we sorted the numbers, but that's not technically correct since the list does
not "ascend" between the first and second 3.  A more correct phrase would be
to describe the sort as *monotonically increasing*.  We should use that phrase
from here forward because 1.) it's technically correct, and 2.) it sounds
cooler.

So, how do we sort these numbers?  In other words, how do we change the
positions of the numbers in the list without losing any of the numbers?

Often, the best way to solve a problem is to think of a very simple instance of
that problem, and then invent a simple solution.  If we can find the smallest
number in the list, where in the list should it go?  The smallest number should
always come first in the list, right?

Suppose we have the following list.

.. code-block:: python

   numbers = [8, 4, 3, 9, 5]

3 is the smallest number, so 3 should move to position 0, the start of the list.
However, if we're going to move the 3 to position 0, we need to find a new home
for the 8.  So, we'll put 8 where the 3 was.

.. code-block:: python

   # Before
   numbers = [8, 4, 3, 9, 5]
   # After
   numbers = [3, 4, 8, 9, 5]

None of the other numbers are touched in moving the 3 and the 8.  Exchanging
positions for the 3 and the 8 is called *swapping* the numbers.  In fact, you
learned how to swap values in a list back in Chapter 5.  Now would be a good
time to go back and view Listing :numref:`%s <swap_good>` and Figure
:numref:`%s <fig_swap_good>` in Section :numref:`%s <sec_list_ops>` again.

Now that the smallest item has been moved into position 0, we can do the same
thing with the next smallest item.  Where should the next smallest item go?  In
other words, what position should hold the next smallest item?  If you said
position 1, you're correct!

.. code-block:: python

   # Original list
   numbers = [8, 4, 3, 9, 5]
   # Moving the smallest to position 0 by swapping.
   numbers = [3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
   # Moving the next smallest to position 1 by swapping.
   numbers = [3, 4, 8, 9, 5]

Oh dear!  Nothing changed!  Actually, nothing needed to change. The 4 was
already at its desired position.  The computer doesn't need to notice this.  We
don't need to check to see if they swap needs to happen.  We can always perform
the swap, because we can swap a number with itself with no unfortunate side
effects.

We can continue this procedure to move each subsequent number to the correct
position in the list.  When we have one final item remaining, we know that
number is the biggest the number, and it should simply remain at the end of the
list.

In each step ``x``, we swap the next smallest value to position ``x``.  We scan
across from position ``x`` to the end of the list, looking for and keeping track
of the position of the smallest.  When we are done scanning, we perform the
swap.  We can see what this procedure looks like in Figure
:numref:`%s <fig_selsort_steps>`.  We've underlined the eventual position
of smallest item that we have selected and swapped.  In fact, this sort is
named *selection sort* because of how we select the smallest item in each step.

.. _fig_selsort_steps:

   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Selection sort steps

   Selection sort steps

There are a couple of things to note in the example shown that will help us
write actual code.  This is often how we come up with code that solves problems.
We make up an example to help us think more concretely, and then we use that
concrete example to help us see patterns that become our code.  In Figure
:numref:`%s <fig_selsort_steps>`, you can see that we are starting each scan
to find the smallest item at positions 0, 1, 2, and finally 3.  3 is one less
than the last index in the list.  We will need a loop to perform the scan to
select the smallest item, and we will need another loop (outside of the scan
loop) to control where we start each scan.

Try to write the code yourself before going on to the next section.  Don't cheat
and look ahead.  Make a focused attempt, hand-written on paper before you
proceed.

.. _sec_selsort:

The Selection Sort
------------------

Let's walk through the advice given at the end of Section
:numref:`%s <sec_sort_algo>`.  Rather than name our list ``numbers``,
we'll name it ``L`` (hey, fewer keystrokes!).

In each step of the selection sort, we scan across the list from beginning to
end looking for the smallest item.  We want to note the position/index where the
smallest item sits (we'll call it ``smallpos``).

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   smallpos = 0
   for i in range(1, len(L)):
       if L[i] < L[smallpos]:
           smallpos = i

This code assumes we start looking for the smallest at index 0.  We let index 0
be the first smallest, and then we scan across from index 1 onward.  However, we
don't want to start at index 0 every time.  We want to start at index 0 to find
the first smallest item, then we want to start at index 1 to find the next
smallest, and so forth.  So, the starting position needs to become a variable
since the starting position needs to change each time.  We'll named that
variable ``start``.  Notice how the code changes on lines 1 and 2 of the code.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 1,2

   smallpos = start
   for i in range(start+1, len(L)):
       if L[i] < L[smallpos]:
           smallpos = i

Now that we have a ``start`` variable to control the starting position of each
scan through the list, we need a loop to update it in each step of the
algorithm.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   for start in range(...):
       smallpos = start
       for i in range(start+1, len(L)):
           if L[i] < L[smallpos]:
               smallpos = i

What should we put in ``range`` in line 1?  The first value of ``start`` should
clearly be 0.  What about the last value?  From looking at
Figure :numref:`%s <fig_selsort_steps>`, we want the last time through the
loop to be the next to last index.  Therefore, the expression that ends the
loop should be ``len(L)-1``, like in the following code.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   for start in range(0, len(L)-1):
       smallpos = start
       for i in range(start+1, len(L)):
           if L[i] < L[smallpos]:
               smallpos = i

This code now does successive scans across the list, but it doesn't actually
swap any values.  Once we're finished with the scan, but before we do another
scan, we need to swap values between the positions stored in ``start`` and
``smallpos``.  The final solution is shown in Listing :numref:`%s <selsort>`.

.. _selsort:
.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Selection Sort

   for start in range(0, len(L)-1):
       # Find the smallest value and keep track of its position.
       smallpos = start
       for index in range(start+1, len(L)):
           if L[index] < L[smallpos]:
               smallpos = index
   
       # Swap the smallest value to the correct location,
       # i.e., where we started our walk through the list.
       temp = L[start]
       L[start] = L[smallpos]
       L[smallpos] = temp


This code works for any list we name ``L`` that has values that can be compared
with the ``<`` operator.  If we fill ``L`` with numbers, this code works.  If we
fill ``L`` with strings, it also works (can you guess how it orders strings?).

We can take this one step further and wrap it into a function that we can call.  See Listing :numref:`%s <selsort_func>`.

.. _selsort_func:
.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Selection Sort as a Function

   def selsort(L):
       for start in range(0, len(L)-1):
           # Find the smallest value and keep track of its position.
           smallpos = start
           for index in range(start+1, len(L)):
               if L[index] < L[smallpos]:
                   smallpos = index
   
           # Swap the smallest value to the correct location,
           # i.e., where we started our walk through the list.
           temp = L[start]
           L[start] = L[smallpos]
           L[smallpos] = temp

Then, we could call the function like this.

.. code-block:: python

   numbers = [3, 4, 1, 5, 2]
   names = ["Becky", "Allen", "Derek", "Casey"]
   selsort(numbers)
   selsort(names)
   print(numbers)  # Output is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   print(names)    # Output is ["Allen", "Becky", "Casey", "Derek"]

.. _sec_binsearch:

Searching for Items in Sorted Data
----------------------------------

Human beings can find things easier in a list that has been sorted because they
can eliminate sections of the list as they quickly visually scan its contents.
Computers, too, can more easily find items in a list that has been pre-sorted.

Consider a long, unordered list of names.  In order to determine if the name
"Ned" exists in the list using a computer program, we would need to linearly
scan the list from beginning to end.  The number of comparisons we would need to
do, in the worst case, would be equal to the number of items in the list.

Suppose, however, that the list is pre-sorted.  We can reduce the number of
comparisons between examining the middle item.  If the name we seek comes before
that middle item, we know that if the name exists in the list, it must exist in
the first half of the list.  Conversely, if the name we seek comes
alphabetically after that middle item, we know that if the name exists in the
list, it must exist in the latter half of the list.  In that first step, we have
eliminated *half* of all the items.  This can speed up our search dramatically.
Keep in mind that if the middle item is the name we were looking for in the
first place, then we have found the name in only one comparison.

The algorithm we just described is called a *binary search*.  To invent code
that performs a binary search, let's take the a similar approach to what we did
with selection sort.  We will start with an example, and observe patterns that
we can turn into code.

Suppose we have a pre-sorted list ``L`` defined in the following way.

.. code-block:: python

   L = [2, 4, 7, 10, 13, 18, 25]

The middle item in this list happens to be ``10``, found at index ``3``.  We know
that ``3`` is the middle index because ``len(L) == 7`` and ``7 // 2 == 3`` (recall
that the ``//`` operator does integer division... it divides and then drops the
fractional part).

Let's try to find ``18`` in ``L``.  We compare ``18 > 10`` to find that ``18`` is
greater than the middle.  This means that if the ``18`` is in our list, it must be
in the right half of the list.  So, we now only need to look at the sublist
``[13, 18, 25]``.  We've reduced the number of items left to check to half!

So, how do we proceed from here?  How do we keep track of which part of the list
we're currently examining.  Well, as always, if we want to keep track of
something or somethings, we use variables.  Let's let ``i`` and ``j`` be index
variables that hold the positions of the leftmost item and rightmost item
respectively.  Let's also create a variable ``m`` to calculate the index of the
middle item.  Figure :numref:`%s <fig_binsearch_1>` demonstrates the steps that
will find ``18`` in ``L``. Observe how ``i``, ``j``, and ``m`` change in each step.

.. _fig_binsearch_1:
.. figure:: images/ch8/binsearch-1.png
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Binary search steps, scenario 1

   Binary search steps, scenario 1

If ``18`` is greater than the middle (that is, if ``18 > L[m]``), then we move ``i``
to the right of ``m`` (that is, ``i = m + 1``).  What would be do if ``18`` were less
than the middle?  Then we would move ``j`` instead by moving it to the left of ``m``
(that is, ``j = m - 1``).

We can see that in two steps, binary search is able to find the ``18`` in our
example list.  That's fast!  With a normal scan/search, it would have taken us 6
comparisons.

Wait a minute.  What happens if we apply these same steps to look for a number
that doesn't exist in ``L``. How about ``17``?  Figure :numref:`%s <fig_binsearch_2>` walks
us through that scenario.

.. _fig_binsearch_2:
.. figure:: images/ch8/binsearch-2.png
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Binary search steps, scenario 2

   Binary search steps, scenario 2

We are left with the idea that we will probably need to use a loop that
continues to look for our target number, and the job of the loop's body will be
to either move ``i`` or ``j`` in each step.  Terminal conditions for the loop are:

* We found our target number, or
* ``i`` and ``j`` have "crossed" (that is ``i > j``), so our target number cannot be found

Okay, now its your turn.  Can you attempt to construct the code for a binary
search?  Once the code is done, ``m`` should be set to the index of the found
target number.  If we don't find the number, let's set ``m`` to ``-1``.  Remember
what we just said.  We need a loop whose job (the body of the loop) is to move
``i`` and ``j`` and calculate ``m``.  The terminal conditions for the loop are given
above.  There may not be one single right way to write this code, so don't worry
about trying to do the one right way.  Play around with it for a while on paper
first.  Try your best before looking ahead.

How far did you get?  Where did you get stuck?  You can learn a lot about how
you solve problems and what types of things get you stuck by doing exercises
like this.

Here is one possible solution.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   x = 18   # x will be our target number
   i = 0
   j = len(L) - 1

   while i <= j:
       # Find the middle index.
       m = (i + j) // 2
       if x < L[m]:
           # Look at the left half of L
           j = m - 1
       elif x > L[m]:
           # Look at the right half of L
           i = m + 1
       else:
           # Found it
           break
   
   if i > j:
       m = -1

Note that ``x`` is not less than the middle and not greater than the middle, then
it must be equal to the middle.

We can easily place this code into a function that we could call to find items
in a list.  We can pass to the function two values: 1.) the list ``L``, and 2.)
the target item ``x``.  The function should return the correct value of ``m``, which
should be ``-1`` if we didn't find the target item, or some integer ``>= 0`` if we
did find it.  See Listing :numref:`%s <binsearch_func>`.

.. _binsearch_func:
.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :caption: Binary Search as a Function

   def binsearch(L, x):
       i = 0
       j = len(L) - 1
   
       while i <= j:
           # Find the middle index.
           m = (i + j) // 2
           if x < L[m]:
               # Look at the left half of L.
               j = m - 1
           elif x > L[m]:
               # Look at the right half of L.
               i = m + 1
           else:
               # Found it.
               return m

       # Didn't find x in the loop.
       return -1

.. _sec_recursion:

(Optional) Using Recursion to Search
------------------------------------

Binary search is a clever way to find a value in a list when the list values are in sorted order.  Suppose we wanted to explain how it works to a friend.  We might use the following description.  If we want to find a value in an ordered list, look at the middle item.  If that's the value we want, great.  We found it!  If not, we ask if the value we want is smaller or larger than the middle.  If its smaller, repeat the process again for the left "half" of the list.  Otherwise, repeat it for the right "half" of the list.

Did you notice what we just did?  We have recast the problem in terms of solving smaller versions of the problem itself.  We could have said something like, "It the value isn't in the middle, binary search either the left part or the right part." 

You might recall from Section :numref:`%s <sec_funcs_recursion>` that this problem might be solvable using recursion.  A recursive function is one that calls itself, though calling itself using a different parameter value each time.

The binary search function in the previous section was called with only two parameters, ``L`` and ``x``.  If you need to refresh your memory, take a look again at Listing :numref:`%s <binsearch_func>`.  ``L`` was the list, and ``x`` was the value we wish to find. If we are going perform a binary search recursively, each time the binsearch function calls itself, it will need more information than just ``L`` and ``x``.  We will also need to pass the list indices that mark what part of the list that concerns us at that point.  Let's call the beginning index ``i`` and the end index ``j`` just like we did in the body of the function in Listing :numref:`%s <binsearch_func>`.

With this in mind, let's define a new function named ``rbinsearch`` (the "r" makes us think of the word "recursion") and let's have the signature of that function become ``rbinsearch(L, x, i, j)``.  Now, let's use what we've learned about programming recursive functions. Often, we use an ``if`` statement.  The first condition is the simplest.  In this case, if ``i`` and ``j`` have crossed, we don't have anything left in the list to search, so we can return ``-1``.  Otherwise, we can compute ``m`` as we did before.  If ``x`` is at ``L[m]``, we found it and can return ``m``.  If not, we can recursively call ``rbinsearch``.  Try to write the code and define the function on your own.  You can test your code using the following examples.  If your function works properly, the code below should print ``True`` three times.

.. code-block:: python

   M = [1, 2, 7, 9, 13]
   print(rbinsearch(M, 2, 0, len(M) - 1) == M.index(2))
   print(rbinsearch(M, 13, 0, len(M) - 1) == M.index(13))
   print(rbinsearch(M, 14, 0, len(M) - 1) == -1)

How did you do?  Where did you get stuck?  You can look at Listing :numref:`%s <rbinsearch_func>` for an example solution.  We should notice that calling ``rbinsearch`` is really clunky because we have to pass ``0`` and ``len(M) - 1`` every time.  We can redefine ``binsearch`` to call ``rbinsearch``.  In other words, ``binsearch(L, x)`` will call ``rbinsearch(L, x, 0, len(L) - 1)``.  Sometimes programmers will call a function like ``rbinsearch`` a "helper" function, because the function you call in the first place (in this case, ``binsearch``) then calls another function to do the actual work.

.. _rbinsearch_func:
.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :caption: Recursive Binary Search

   # The "helper" recursive function
   def rbinsearch(L, x, i, j):
       if i > j:
           return -1
       else:
           m = (i + j) // 2
           if x == L[m]:
               return m
           elif x < L[m]:
               return rbinsearch(L, x, i, m - 1)
           else:
               return rbinsearch(L, x, m + 1, j)

   # The function we actually call, which in turn calls the "helper" function.
   def binsearch(L, x):
       return rbinsearch(L, x, 0, len(L) - 1)

#. Demonstrate how selection sort would order the following list:

   .. code-block:: python

      [27, 34, 12, 9, 13]

   Show each step of the sort, even if that step does not move an item.

#. Demonstrate how selection sort would order the following list:

   .. code-block:: python

      ["carrots", "peas", "broccoli", "bok choy"]

   Show each step of the sort, even if that step does not move an item.

#. Suppose we have two lists that represent students' names and their grade point averages (GPAs).

   .. code-block:: python

      names = ["Jennifer", "Alfred", "Jack"]
      gpas = [4.0, 3.1, 2.7]

   Also suppose that the names and GPAs line up with one another.  In other words, Jennifer's GPA is 4.0, Alfred's GPA is 2.7, and Javier's GPA is 3.1.  If we were to sort ``names`` without also reordering ``gpas``, Alfred's GPA would become 4.0 (which I'm sure would make him happy, but it would be wrong).

   Define a function named ``sort_all`` that takes a list of lists.  The function should sort the first list and then reorder all other lists in the same way as the first list.

   .. code-block:: python

      # Example 1:
      names = ["Jennifer", "Alfred", "Jack"]
      gpas = [4.0, 3.1, 2.7]
      sort_all([names, gpas])
      print(names)  # Output is ["Alfred", "Jack", "Jennifer"]
      print(gpas)   # Output is [3.1, 2.7, 4.0]

      # Example 2:
      names = ["Jennifer", "Alfred", "Jack"]
      gpas = [4.0, 3.1, 2.7]
      sort_all([gpas, names]) # we are sorting by GPA this time
      print(names)  # Output is ["Jack", "Alfred", "Jennifer"]
      print(gpas)   # Output is [2.7, 3.1, 4.0]
